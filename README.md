# Graph-based Assembler for Plant Mito-genomes (GAPM)

An effective pipeline to assembly plant mitochondrial genomes into simple and accurate graphs, consisting of many graph-based tools for processing the genome assembly results and high throughout sequencing data.

GAPM is under testing now and will be released later.
